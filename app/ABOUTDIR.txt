* This app directory is the single entry point into
  the React Native app.

- Its main purpose is to hold all usable sharable
  code for both React Native Apps

- The app directory also includes an index.js file.
  Its job is to be the entry point for our cross
  platform application. Where we will require our
  index.ios.js and index.android.js files. This is
  the starting point for ios and android.
